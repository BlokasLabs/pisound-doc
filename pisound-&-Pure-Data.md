# pisound & Pure Data

Using pisound you can run your Pure Data patches straight from a USB thumb drive with a press of a button with no need to connect an external monitor, keyboard or mouse.

Plug in a USB drive containing your Pure Data patch, main patch file called **main.pd**, plug in any additional MIDI controller/keyboard, press The Button and Voil√†!

You can read more about The Button functionality [here](#the-button).

If you haven't already, you can install Pure Data by running the following command in a Terminal window:

```
sudo apt-get install puredata
```
